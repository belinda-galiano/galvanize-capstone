## This is a project in progress that I am developing.

# galvanize-capstone
What we eat is central to our health. The food gives our bodies the "information" and the materials they need to function properly. If we don't get the right information, our metabolic processes suffer and our health declines.

If we get too much food or food that gives our bodies the wrong instructions, we can become overweight, undernourished, and at risk for the development of diseases and conditions, such as arthritis, diabetes, and heart disease.

For that reason is important to track the food's nutrients that we need.

### Project Description
The project is about building an application that allows writing cooking recipes and visualize the nutritional facts of those recipes based on the ingredients. Users also have the possibility to save those recipes or filter them according to their preferences.

### Problem Statement
It is difficult to keep track of the food's nutrients that you consume in real time.

When you write a recipe or change the ingredients of an existing recipe or change the quantities of those ingredients, there is no way to quickly and painlessly calculate the nutritional facts of that recipe or visualize the changes that occur in the nutritional facts as a result of the alterations.

### How will the project solve this problem?
The application is going to track the recipe’s nutrients in real time.
